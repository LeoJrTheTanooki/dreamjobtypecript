#### Description: A website built in React Typescript that shows off my dream jobs
#### Peer Reviewer: Avery Hillstrom
#### Review Notes: Website is very clear and concise, the formatting is easy to read and each page provides a good summary of each company and what they do and what their missions are. All pages and routing works, overall a great website! I would personally add a little spacing between the top and bottom row of cards on the home page, but that is really the only critique I have about it.
